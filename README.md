## Design

### Design Choices

My goal is to create a simple and efficent website so all features are easily accessible. In order to achieve this, all pages are responive and labeled. All content is made easy to read with links to features clearly visible without being excessive.

### Colours
The colour sheme was chosen as a dark red and black theme in which i was aided by Adobe Color by using their Split Complementary Color feature. A light grey and simple white was used to give it contrast which was selected also through adobe color. A slighly dark grey was selected for certain elements in the events page.
<br>
 
![Colour scheme](docs/color-palette.png)


### Fonts
Kanit was used for the logo, heading and sub-heading's. 
<br>
Martel Sans was used for smaller body elements and navbar . 
<br>
The fonts chosen because of the contrast between them with Kanit's loopless lettering matching Martel Sans' fluidity. The match for this font was made through fontjoy.
<br>
San-serif was used as my backup.

## Structure
