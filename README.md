## Design

### Design Choices

My goal is to create a simple and efficent website so all features are easily accessible. In order to achieve this, all pages are responive and labeled. All content is made easy to read with links to features clearly visible without being excessive.

### Colour
The colour sheme was chosen as a dark red and black theme in which i was aided by Adobe Color by using their Split Complementary Color feature. A light grey and simple white was used to give it contrast which was selected also through adobe color. A slighly dark grey was selected for certain elements in the events page.
<br>
 
![Colour scheme](docs/color-palette.png)


### Fonts
Kanit was used for the logo, heading and sub-heading's. 
<br>
Martel Sans was used for smaller body elements and navbar . 
<br>
The fonts chosen because of the contrast between them with Kanit's loopless lettering matching Martel Sans' fluidity. The match for this font was made through fontjoy.
<br>
San-serif was used as my backup.

### Structure
The home page is designed to have all relevanet information easily accessible with all relevent navigation clearly visible. The logo is postioned on the left, navigation on the right and this is shown on all pages in the same layout. The design is created also to be responsive on all viewports while maintaing all relevant information: 
- Homepage with a hero image with login details/bookings anchor. Cards are also used with details and links to other pages of the site.
- Food menu has the current list of all available foods from the database sorted by different sections of the menu
- Drinks menu has the current list of all available drinks from the database sorted by different sections of the menu
- Blog page has a paginated list of blogs posted by an admin or authorised user, 6 per page
- Blog expanded displays a blog the user has selected so they can read the blog, if they are logged in they can also leave a comment or like the comment which will then need to be approved before it is displayed.
- Reservations page allows registered users to book a table , date requested, time requested and guest count
- My bookings displays all confirmed reservations for the user that they have made
- My bookings page aloso lets users edit or cancel any confirmed reservations made
- Cancel booking allows the user to cancel the booking which will then delete it from the database
- A contacts page with a message section, the address and a map should the user need to contact the restaurant
- Login / Logout allows users to login to make bookings, view, edit, and delete bookings
- Register section allows to have their details stored for easier access to interact with sections of the site
- 404 page is displayed when a 404 error is raised
